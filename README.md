Hi guy, finally I installed Magisk on VMOS successfully!! Magisk daemon can be running but it can't work properly.
Magisk app can't detect installed Magisk.

Remember: All "Magisk on VMOS" videos uploaded to YouTube are fake.  They just install the Magisk manager app (like any app you install with "file.apk") on the VMOS.
