Hi guy, finally I installed Magisk on VMOS successfully!! Magisk daemon can be running but it can't work properly maybe due to VM limitations.
Magisk app can't detect installed Magisk.

But I can grant MagiskSU (make a Superuser request)...

Remember: All "Magisk on VMOS" videos uploaded to YouTube are fake.  They just install the Magisk manager app (like any app you install with "file.apk") on the VMOS.

NEW!! Magisk Manager v.8.0.0 can detect installed Magisk.

I have made a script to install Magisk as VMOS Tool Terminal modification on VMOS. NOTE that Magisk on VMOS cannot work properly and it is for TEST only!!!
